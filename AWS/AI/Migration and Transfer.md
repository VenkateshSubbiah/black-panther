## AWS Application Discovery Service
### Overview of AWS Application Discovery Service
AWS Application Discovery Service helps you plan your migration to AWS by automatically identifying and gathering information about your on-premises applications. It provides insights into application dependencies, performance characteristics, and utilization patterns.

### Key Features
- **Automated Discovery**: Automatically identifies on-premises servers, applications, and their dependencies.
- **Data Collection**: Gathers metrics such as CPU, memory, disk, and network utilization, as well as application dependencies.
- **Integration with Migration Tools**: Works with AWS Migration Hub and AWS Server Migration Service (SMS) to streamline the migration process.
- **Customization**: Allows for custom tagging and categorization of discovered applications for better organization and tracking.

### How It Works
1. **Agent Installation**: An agent is installed on on-premises servers to collect application and resource data. The agent communicates with the AWS Application Discovery Service to send collected information.
2. **Data Analysis**: The service analyzes the data collected by the agents, providing insights into application performance and dependencies.
3. **Reporting**: Provides reports and dashboards within the AWS Management Console, summarizing the discovery results and visualizing application dependencies.

### Types of Discovery
- **Agent-Based Discovery**: Utilizes agents installed on on-premises servers to collect detailed data about running applications and their resource usage.
